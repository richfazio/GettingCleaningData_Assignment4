Post process data sourced from 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

You will be required to submit: 

1) a tidy data set as described below, 

2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, and 

3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

Inputs:
Data as described from ici.edu website

Process:
1) Initialization - prep environment
2) Pull data file
3) Load all data into workspace
4) Merge training/test data together
5) Select just the mean/std dev features from published files
6) Add labels to selected data (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)
7) Create superset
8) Pretty up labels of selected data
9) Compute summary metrics
10) Publish new summary file

Outputs:
Single "tidy" file.  Attributes specified in Assignment4_FieldSpec.xls
Filename: tidy_data_X_Y_subject_avg.txt
Format: created by R write.table

activity_labels <- read.table("./UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt")
Y[, 1] <- activity_labels[Y[, 1], 2]
names(Y) <- "Activity"
